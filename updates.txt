DOUBTS TO BE CLARIFIED
In the all included 2nd point entity data is missing for the approval_matrix xlsx they have shared with us. Like for which one what should we take.
in the purchase request form what should we keep in the place of location for now it is taking static data
and for business justification code what should we keep
if a user raises a pr and the approver returns the request because it is wrong department or site then it should go with the same pr number or we have to change it to the new one
