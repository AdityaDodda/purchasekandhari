DOUBTS TO BE CLARIFIED
In the all included 2nd point entity data is missing for the approval_matrix xlsx they have shared with us. Like for which one what should we take.
in the purchase request form what should we keep in the place of location for now it is taking static data
and for business justification code what should we keep
if a user raises a pr and the approver returns the request because it is wrong department or site then it should go with the same pr number or we have to change it to the new one

as you can observe the schema.prisma and routes.ts i am updating escalation_matrix for the full approver list and the manager list now i want to use node-cron and set a timer where when a requester submits a request it goes to approver_1 but if he doesn't approve in 12hrs it should escalate to manager_1 and we should give both manager,approver_1 rights for approving then if one of them approves it should go to approver 2 then we have to take the time from when the first approver approved 12 hrs he doesn't approve it should escalate to manager_2 but both the manager_2 and approver_2 has the rights for approving and after one of them approves it should go to third level where we have to check whether 24hrs has passed since approver_2 approved the request then we have to reject the request in this we have to consider excluding sundays
